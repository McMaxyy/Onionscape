# Onionscape

The last thing you remember before waking up is a loud city-wide alarm and every news channel telling you to stay inside.

Humanity has failed. 

Centuries of releasing toxic chemicals and gasses had finally come to a breaking point and the planet retaliated against the human plague with a mist, only harmful to humans.
In the process of eradicating humanity, the wildlife had also been affected, resulting in mutations. 

After decades, the mist has finally subsided and you wake up, but the body you wake up in isn't yours. 
You panic as your skin has an onion-like texture. What happened? How could this happen? You look around the forest, trying to find some reflective surface, so that you can see what you've become.
Finally, you find a broken mirror lodged inside a tree, you look at it and discover that your once human body has turned into an onion?
After some time, you decide that you're going to get to the bottom of this and hopefully find a cure. There must be other people somewhere, right?
You set off in search of answers, but you can't do it without tools, equipment. 

Welcome to the world of Onionscape. You're an onion and you're determined to find out just what happened to the world. Good luck.
